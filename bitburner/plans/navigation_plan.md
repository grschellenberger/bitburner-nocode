# Network Mapping Script Development Plan

This document outlines the steps required to develop a script that maps a network and displays it in a hierarchical format. The script will also generate navigation commands when provided with an argument.

## Step 1: Define the Network Structure

1. **Understand the Network Hierarchy**: 
   - The network is structured in a tree-like format with a "Home" node at the root.
   - Each server can have multiple child servers.

2. **Create a Data Structure**:
   - Use a dictionary or a custom class to represent the network. Each node should have a name and a list of child nodes.

## Step 2: Implement the Network Mapping

1. **Write a Function to Display the Network**:
   - Create a recursive function that prints the network hierarchy.
   - Use indentation to represent the depth of each server in the hierarchy.

2. **Test the Display Function**:
   - Manually create a small network and test the function to ensure it displays correctly.

## Step 3: Implement Navigation Command Generation

1. **Write a Function to Generate Commands**:
   - Create a function that takes a server name as an argument and generates a series of "connect <server>" commands.
   - The function should traverse the network to find the path to the specified server.

2. **Test the Command Generation**:
   - Test the function with various server names to ensure it generates the correct commands.

## Step 4: Integrate Command-Line Argument Handling

1. **Parse Command-Line Arguments**:
   - Use a library like `argparse` to handle command-line arguments.
   - If no arguments are provided, display the network map.
   - If a server name is provided, generate and display the navigation commands.

2. **Test Argument Handling**:
   - Test the script with and without arguments to ensure it behaves as expected.

## Step 5: Final Testing and Documentation

1. **Conduct Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Test the script with a variety of network configurations and server names.
   - Ensure the script handles edge cases, such as non-existent servers.

2. **Document the Script**:
   - Write comments and documentation within the script to explain its functionality.
   - Ensure the script is easy to understand and maintain.

## Step 6: Deployment

1. **Prepare the Script for Deployment**:
   - Ensure the script is executable and can be run from the command line.
   - Package any dependencies if necessary.

2. **Deploy the Script**:
   - Deploy the script to the target environment and verify its operation.

By following these steps, you will be able to create a script that effectively maps a network and generates navigation commands. Each step should be completed in sequence, with testing and validation at each stage to ensure the script functions correctly.
