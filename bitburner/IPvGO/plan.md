Script Outline for Playing IPvGO

1. **Understand the Game State:**
   - **Access the Board State:**
     - Use the `ns.go.getBoardState()` function to retrieve the current state of the board.
     - Parse the board to identify the positions of your routers ('X'), opponent's routers ('O'), and empty nodes ('.').

   - **Analyze Network Connections:**
     - Identify your networks by checking connected routers.
     - Determine the number of open ports (empty nodes) each network has using `ns.go.analysis.getLiberties()`.

2. **Determine Valid Moves:**
   - **Retrieve Valid Moves:**
     - Use `ns.go.analysis.getValidMoves()` to get a grid of valid moves.
     - Filter out moves that would violate the suicide rule unless they capture opponent routers.

   - **Evaluate Move Options:**
     - Consider moves that expand your network by connecting to friendly routers.
     - Identify moves that can capture opponent networks by surrounding them.
     - Look for defensive moves to protect your networks from being captured.

3. **Select the Best Move:**
   - **Prioritize Moves:**
     - Rank moves based on strategic importance:
       - Capturing opponent networks.
       - Expanding your network's control over empty nodes.
       - Defending vulnerable networks.
     - Consider the opponent's potential responses and adjust priorities accordingly.

   - **Use Heuristics:**
     - Implement simple heuristics to evaluate the potential impact of each move.
     - Consider the number of empty nodes controlled, potential captures, and network stability.

4. **Execute the Move:**
   - **Make the Move:**
     - Use `await ns.go.makeMove(x, y)` to place a router on the selected node.
     - If no beneficial move is found, use `await ns.go.passTurn()` to pass.

5. **Iterate Until Game Ends:**
   - **Loop Until Completion:**
     - Continuously repeat the process of analyzing the board, determining moves, and executing the best move.
     - Monitor the game state for completion conditions (all nodes surrounded or consecutive passes).

6. **Handle Game End:**
   - **Evaluate Results:**
     - Check the final board state to determine the score and outcome.
     - Log the results for analysis and improvement of strategies.

7. **Optimize and Improve:**
   - **Refine Strategies:**
     - Analyze game outcomes to identify weaknesses in the strategy.
     - Adjust heuristics and move priorities based on observed patterns and opponent behavior.

8. **Additional Considerations:**
   - **Logging and Debugging:**
     - Implement logging to track decisions and outcomes for debugging and strategy refinement.
   - **Error Handling:**
     - Ensure robust error handling to manage unexpected game states or API issues.
